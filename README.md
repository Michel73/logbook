# logbook

Here are some installation logbooks of my machines.  
I just want to store my notices what I have done on one of my hosts in version controlled files.

## Setup

I use `grip` to view the markdown files in the browser while editing them.

```
gvim Install-MacBookPro.md
open http://localhost:5000
grip Install-MacBookPro.md
```
